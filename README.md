at first,  you need to clone the repository to your computer. 

secondly, you need to install npm modules from the MAIN folder and from the back-end folder. You can do this by writing in console “npm i”(in the main folder), “cd back-end “ => “npm i”. 

the next step will be launching front-end and back-end. 

for launching front-end - “npm start”
for launching back-end - “cd back-end “ => “npm run dev”
